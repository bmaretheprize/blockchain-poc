### What is Bitcoin
Peer to peer currency via blockchain. 

- Think of it as a bunch of decentralized databases, where each database is shares a synchronized instance of the ledger.
- The ledger is basically just a list of all the transactions that happened across the blockchain
- The block is essentially a group of transactions. Think a linked list, where each node represents a group of transactions (a block).
- The chain is the entirety of the linked list essentially.
- Each new block is linked to the previous block
- Each user (or wallet) has a public key for receiving money and a private key for spending money
- Each transaction has a hash / cryptographic representation of the previous transaction and the new owners public key. The hash is then signed with the previous owner's private key

### What is Blockchain (For Bitcoin)
Blockchain is just a distributed ledger, where data is chained together via cryptographic technique(s)
- A block on the blockchain can be thought of as a cell in a spread sheet or a node in a linked list. The chain contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The block header consists of the following...
- Software version
- Previous block hash
- Merkle root - a single has that contains all the hashed info from previous transactions
- Timestamp
- Difficultyy target
- Nonce




# Solana
Is a decentralized smart contracts block chain for decentralizing compute.

### What is Solana
Solana is
